# Week 6
## Tried genetic algorithm and 3 opt method
* the genetic algorithm took too long so decided to run in 3opt
* 3opt is a local search algorithm that tries to find the best solution by swapping the order of the cities

### Score Result
```
challenge:6
3opt: 46755.49

challenge:7
3opt: 99709.99
```

* I combined 3 opt and 2 opt which gave me a slightly better result
```
challenge:6
3&2opt: 45371.21

challenge:7
